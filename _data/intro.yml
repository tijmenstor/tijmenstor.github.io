  I am Tijmen, a DevOps/DevSecOps/Release Engineer based around Amsterdam! Currently, I am a DevOps Engineer at Devleaps and a Release Engineer at Vandebron through Devleaps.
  My experience lies mostly within the CI/CD domain, working with technologies such as GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Kubernetes and Docker.
  I script usually with Bash, Python or Java/TypeScript, but I also have experience building software with Golang and Java/Kotlin.
  Looking to make developers as happy as possible, always!
