  I am a Dev(Sec)Ops Engineer working at Devleaps. 
  I enjoy constantly improving the developer lifecycle and experience, so they can do what they do best as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
  I love working with the newest, preferably open-source, technologies and implementing those. Most of my recent experience is with GitHub, ArgoCD, Kubernetes and Docker. 
  I also have previous programming experience with Java/Kotlin and TypeScript, whereas I now mainly make use of Bash and Python for scripting.
